Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. The reason is that it uses user-controlled input (the commit_id, which is derived from the BUILD_SOURCEVERSIONMESSAGE environment variable) in a subprocess.run() call. If an attacker can control the value of BUILD_SOURCEVERSIONMESSAGE, they could potentially inject arbitrary commands to be executed by the subprocess.run() call. This is a classic example of an OS command injection vulnerability.
