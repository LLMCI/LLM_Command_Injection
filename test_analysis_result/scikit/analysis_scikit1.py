No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The code is using the subprocess.run() function to execute a command, but the command and its arguments are hardcoded and do not include any user-supplied input. The only user-supplied input is the path to the sklearn directory, which is used to find .pxd files and generate a Cython extension. This input is not used in a context where command or code injection could occur. 

The code is also using the tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() function to create a temporary directory, which is a safe operation that does not pose a risk of command or code injection. 

The code is also using the pathlib.Path() function to manipulate file paths, which is a safe operation that does not pose a risk of command or code injection. 

The code is also using the textwrap.dedent() function to remove leading whitespace from a string, which is a safe operation that does not pose a risk of command or code injection. 

Therefore, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability.
