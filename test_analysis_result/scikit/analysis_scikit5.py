No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The command that is being executed by subprocess.check_output() is a static string, and there is no user input being formatted into the command string. Therefore, there is no opportunity for an attacker to inject arbitrary commands. 

The use of REVISION_CMD.split() ensures that the command and its arguments are passed as a list of strings, which is safer than passing a single string that the shell must parse. This avoids shell injection vulnerabilities.
