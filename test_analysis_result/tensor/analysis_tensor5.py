Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The vulnerability lies in the use of the `subprocess.check_output` function with `shell=True` argument. This allows the execution of shell commands which can be potentially dangerous if an attacker is able to inject malicious commands. 

In this case, the `gcc_path_cmd` is a hardcoded string, so it doesn't present an immediate risk. However, if in the future the code is modified to accept user input or other external data sources to form the `gcc_path_cmd`, it could be exploited to run arbitrary commands. 

To mitigate this risk, it's recommended to avoid using `shell=True` whenever possible, or ensure that any user input or external data is properly sanitized before being used in a shell command.
