Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is the use of the exec() function. The exec() function is used to execute dynamically created program, which can be a source of significant security risk because it can execute arbitrary Python code. If an attacker can influence the input to exec(), they can run arbitrary commands, leading to a serious security vulnerability. 

In this case, the exec() function is being passed a string that is constructed from user input (tmp_1002). If an attacker can control the value of tmp_1002, they can inject arbitrary code that will be executed by the exec() function. 

Additionally, the use of globals() and locals() as arguments to exec() can also lead to security vulnerabilities, as they can expose all global and local Python variables to the executed code. 

Therefore, it's generally recommended to avoid using exec() if possible, or to use it with extreme caution, ensuring that user input can't influence the executed code.
