No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that the code uses the subprocess.check_output function in a safe way. It passes the command and its arguments as a list of strings, which means that the command is not processed through a shell and thus no shell metacharacters can be injected into it. 

The only user-supplied input is sys.argv[1], which is passed as an argument to the grep command. However, since this argument is not processed through a shell, it cannot be used to inject additional commands. 

The code also uses regular expressions in a safe way. The regular expression '(failures|errors)="[1-9]' is hard-coded and does not include any user-supplied input, so there is no risk of regular expression injection. 

Therefore, this code is safe from command/code injection attacks.
