No, this code does not have potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The code uses the subprocess.run() function to execute a command, but the command and its arguments are not constructed from external input. They are derived from internal variables and constants. The user-provided arguments are not directly included in the command string, but are written to a file and then passed to the command as a file argument. This prevents the possibility of command injection, as the user cannot modify the command string to execute arbitrary commands. 

Furthermore, the code checks the type of the arguments and raises an error if an unsupported type is provided. This further reduces the possibility of code injection, as the user cannot provide arbitrary code to be executed. 

However, it's always a good practice to sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent any potential security vulnerabilities.
