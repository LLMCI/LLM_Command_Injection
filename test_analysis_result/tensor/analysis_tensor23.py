No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that the code uses the subprocess module's check_output function in a safe way. It passes the command and its arguments as a list, which ensures that they are not processed through a shell and thus cannot be manipulated to execute arbitrary shell commands. 

The code also uses the 'which' function to find the 'ldconfig' command, and if it can't find it, it defaults to a hardcoded string "/sbin/ldconfig". This means that the command being run is not based on any user input or external data that could be manipulated.

The regular expression used to parse the output of the 'ldconfig' command is also safe, as it does not execute any code and only matches a specific pattern in the output lines.

Therefore, there is no command or code injection vulnerability in this code.
