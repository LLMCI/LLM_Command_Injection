Yes, this code has a potential command/code injection vulnerability. The vulnerability lies in the use of the os.system() function, which is used to execute shell commands. The function is called with a string that is constructed from user-controlled input (the names of temporary files). If an attacker can control the content of these strings, they could potentially inject arbitrary shell commands. This is a classic command injection vulnerability. 

In this specific case, the risk is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the strings are names of temporary files created by the tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() function, which are likely to be difficult for an attacker to control. However, it's generally a good practice to avoid using os.system() with user-controlled input whenever possible, to reduce the risk of command injection vulnerabilities. 

A safer alternative would be to use the subprocess module with a list of arguments, which avoids shell command parsing and is therefore less prone to command injection.
