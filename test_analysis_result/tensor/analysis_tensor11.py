No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The only place where user input could potentially be used in a dangerous way is in the eval function. However, in this case, the string being evaluated ("lambda x, y, /, z: x + y + z") is hard-coded and does not include any user input or variables, so there is no opportunity for command or code injection. 

Command or code injection vulnerabilities occur when an application provides an attacker the ability to control its commands or code. This typically happens when user input is either incorrectly filtered or not filtered at all, and then used in a command or code context. In this code, there is no user input being used in such a context.
