No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that the subprocess.check_output() function is called with a list of arguments, which are passed directly to the system call. This means that the shell does not interpret any special characters, so there is no risk of command injection. 

The only user input that is processed is the output of the 'ldconfig -p' command, and this is done using a regular expression, not by executing it as a command. Therefore, even if the output of 'ldconfig -p' was somehow malicious, it would not lead to command injection. 

However, it's worth noting that if the 'which' function or the 'ldconfig' command were somehow compromised, then this could potentially lead to command injection. But this would require an attacker to have already gained a significant level of access to the system, at which point there would be many other, easier ways for them to cause harm.
