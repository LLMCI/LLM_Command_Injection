No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that the subprocess.check_output() function is called with a list of arguments, which means that the shell is not invoked. This is a safer way to use subprocess, as it avoids shell injection vulnerabilities. 

In addition, the regular expression used in the re.match() function is a raw string, which means that it does not interpret backslashes as escape characters. This also helps to prevent injection attacks. 

However, it's worth noting that if the 'path' variable is coming from an untrusted source, it could potentially be manipulated to execute arbitrary commands. Therefore, it's always a good practice to validate and sanitize all inputs.
