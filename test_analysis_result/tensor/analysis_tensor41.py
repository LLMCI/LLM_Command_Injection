No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

Command injection vulnerabilities occur when an application passes unsafe user-supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers, etc.) to a system shell. In this case, the code is not taking any user-supplied data to execute system commands. All the commands and parameters used in the subprocess.Popen and subprocess.check_call methods are hardcoded and do not rely on external user inputs. Therefore, there is no opportunity for a user to inject malicious commands.
