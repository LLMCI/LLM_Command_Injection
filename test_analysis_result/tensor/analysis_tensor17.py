Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. The reason is the use of the exec() function. The exec() function is used to execute dynamically created program, which can be a source of arbitrary code execution if the input is not properly sanitized. In this case, the exec() function is used to execute the 'wrappers' variable, which seems to be loaded from an external library. If an attacker can control the content of this library, they could potentially execute arbitrary code.
