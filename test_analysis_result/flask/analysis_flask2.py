Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. The reason is the use of the exec() function in the from_pyfile method. The exec() function is used to execute dynamically created program, which can be a source of arbitrary code execution if the input is not properly sanitized. In this case, the code is reading from a file and executing its content without any form of validation or sanitization. If an attacker can control the content of the file, they can execute arbitrary Python code.
