Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that it uses the eval() function with user-provided input (the content of the PYTHONSTARTUP file). The eval() function is used to evaluate the Python expression which can be a potential security risk if it's provided with untrusted input. This is because it allows execution of arbitrary Python code. If an attacker can control the content of the PYTHONSTARTUP file, they can execute arbitrary Python code with the privileges of the user running this script.
