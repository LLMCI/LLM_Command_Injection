No, this code does not have potential command/code injection vulnerability.

The reason is that the code does not execute any user-provided input using functions like eval() or exec(). The eval() function used in this code is not Python's built-in eval() function, but a custom function defined in the code. It does not execute arbitrary code, but only evaluates expressions based on a predefined set of operations (SYMPY_INTERP). 

Moreover, the code does not use any form of string formatting or concatenation to create dynamic code snippets. All the operations are performed using predefined functions and operators, and the inputs are strictly type-checked or used in a way that does not allow for arbitrary code execution. 

Therefore, there is no apparent command or code injection vulnerability in this code.
