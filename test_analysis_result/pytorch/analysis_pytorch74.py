Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. The reason is that it uses the exec() function, which is a dangerous function in Python. It executes the Python program which can be dynamically created. This means that an attacker could potentially inject malicious code as the `code` parameter, which would then be executed by the exec() function. This could lead to serious security issues such as arbitrary code execution, data leakage, or server takeover.
