No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

Command or code injection vulnerabilities occur when an application passes unsafe user input to a system shell. In this case, the code is not taking any user input to execute. The exec function is being used, but it's being used to execute a predefined string of code, not arbitrary user input. Therefore, there's no opportunity for a user to inject malicious commands. 

However, it's worth noting that the use of the exec function can be dangerous in other contexts, as it can execute arbitrary Python code. If user input were being passed to exec, that would be a serious security vulnerability. In this case, though, the exec function is not a security risk.
