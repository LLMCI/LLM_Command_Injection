Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that it uses the eval() function, which is a well-known security hole. The eval() function takes a string and evaluates it as Python code. This means that if an attacker can control the input to eval(), they can make the Python interpreter run any code they want. This could include code to delete files, send data over the network, or any other malicious activity.

Even though the code tries to prevent method/function calls by checking the bytecode instructions, it's not a foolproof method. There are ways to bypass this check, for example by using Python's dynamic features, or by constructing a string that when evaluated results in a function call. 

Therefore, it's generally recommended to avoid using eval() if possible, or if it's absolutely necessary, to use it with extreme caution, making sure to properly sanitize and check any input that will be passed to it.
