No, this code does not have potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The code is a test script for some functions in the PyTorch library. It uses exec() function to execute code, but the code executed is not influenced by user input or any external factors. It's a predefined string that is under the control of the program, not an attacker. Therefore, it does not pose a risk of command or code injection. 

Command or code injection vulnerabilities typically arise when a program executes code that is influenced by an attacker, often through user input or manipulated files. In this case, the code being executed is not influenced by external factors, so there is no opportunity for an attacker to inject malicious code.
