No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The code is using the exec() function, which can be a potential security risk if it's used to execute arbitrary user-supplied code. However, in this case, the exec() function is used to execute a string of code that is generated within the program itself, not supplied by the user. The string of code is the result of the PatternPrettyPrinter.run() function, which is presumably a trusted function from the same library. 

Therefore, unless the PatternPrettyPrinter.run() function itself has a vulnerability that allows injection of arbitrary code into its output, this code is not vulnerable to command or code injection.
