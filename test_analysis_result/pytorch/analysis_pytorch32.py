No, this code does not have potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The code is dynamically generating and executing Python code using the exec function, but the input to exec is not influenced by any external or user-provided data. The code that is being generated and executed is completely controlled by the developer and does not include any variables or data that could be manipulated by an attacker. Therefore, there is no opportunity for command or code injection.
