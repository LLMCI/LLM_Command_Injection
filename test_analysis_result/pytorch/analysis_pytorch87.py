Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that it uses the subprocess.Popen function with shell=True when the command is a string. This means that the command is run through the shell, which has its own parsing and can interpret special characters (like semicolons, ampersands, etc.). If an attacker can control the command string, they can potentially append additional commands to be run, leading to command injection. 

To mitigate this, it's recommended to use shell=False whenever possible, or ensure that user input is properly sanitized and escaped before being used in a command.
