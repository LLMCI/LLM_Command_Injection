No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that the code does not take any external input that could be manipulated by a user to inject malicious code. All the inputs to the function are either hard-coded or generated internally by the function itself. The exec function is used to execute a dynamically created function, but the content of this function is not influenced by any external input. Therefore, there is no opportunity for an attacker to inject malicious code.
