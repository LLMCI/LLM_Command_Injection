Yes, this code has a potential command/code injection vulnerability. The main issue lies in the use of the exec() function. The exec() function is used to execute Python code which is passed as an argument. If the argument passed to exec() is formed using unsanitized input from the user, it can lead to command injection attacks. In this code, the exec() function is used to execute the string formed by ignore_func_str, which is constructed using various inputs and could potentially be manipulated to inject malicious code.
