No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

Command injection vulnerabilities occur when an application passes unsafe user-supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers, etc.) to a system shell. In this case, the code is not taking any user-supplied data to form the command to be executed. The commands that are being run are hardcoded and do not depend on user input, thus there is no opportunity for a user to inject malicious commands. 

However, it's worth noting that if the variables `onto_branch` and `orig_ref` are influenced by user input elsewhere in the application, then there could be a potential for command injection. But based on the provided code snippet, there is no direct command injection vulnerability.
