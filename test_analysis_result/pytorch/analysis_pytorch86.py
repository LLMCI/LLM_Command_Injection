No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that the command that is being passed to subprocess.Popen is not being constructed from user input or any other untrusted source. The command is built using static strings and variables that are not influenced by external input. 

The use of shlex.split also helps to prevent command injection as it correctly splits the command string into a list of arguments, which are then passed directly to the subprocess without going through a shell interpreter. This means that even if an attacker could somehow influence the command string, they would not be able to inject additional commands or arguments. 

However, it's always a good practice to validate and sanitize all inputs, even if they are not directly used in command execution.
