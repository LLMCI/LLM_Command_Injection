Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. The reason is that it directly uses the input list "args" in the subprocess.run() function without any sanitization or validation. If an attacker can control the content of "args", they could potentially inject malicious commands. For example, if "args" is ['ls', ';', 'rm', '-rf', '/'], it would first list the files in the current directory and then delete everything on the filesystem.
