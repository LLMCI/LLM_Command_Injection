Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerabilities. 

The main issue lies in the use of the `subprocess.run` function with `shell=True` which can be a security hazard if combined with unsanitized input. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands. 

In this code, the `subprocess.run` function is used multiple times with `shell=True`, and in some cases, it includes variables in the command string such as `env_path` and `git_root`. If an attacker can control the value of these variables, they could potentially inject malicious commands.

For example, if an attacker can control the value of `env_path`, they could set it to a value like `; rm -rf / #` which would delete all files in the system when the `source activate {env_path}` command is run.

To mitigate this risk, it's recommended to avoid using `shell=True` with `subprocess.run` whenever possible, especially when the command string includes variables. If `shell=True` is necessary, make sure to sanitize and validate all inputs that are included in the command string.
