No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that the subprocess.run() function is being called with a list of arguments (args), rather than a single string. When a list of arguments is used, the arguments are passed directly to the program, and no shell is invoked. This means that shell metacharacters (like ;, &&, ||, etc.) in the arguments do not have any special meaning, and cannot be used to execute additional commands. 

If the subprocess.run() function was called with a single string argument, then a shell would be invoked, and shell metacharacters in the string could be used to execute additional commands, leading to a command injection vulnerability. But that is not the case here. 

The code also uses the check=True argument, which means that if the command returns a non-zero exit status (indicating an error), a CalledProcessError exception is raised. This is a good practice, as it helps to catch and handle errors. 

The code also uses the capture_output=True argument, which means that the output of the command is captured and returned, rather than being written to stdout and stderr. This is also a good practice, as it allows the output of the command to be processed in the Python code, rather than being displayed to the user or written to a log file. 

The code also uses the encoding="utf-8" argument, which means that the output of the command is decoded using the UTF-8 encoding. This is a good practice, as it ensures that the output is correctly decoded, regardless of the default encoding of the system. 

The code also logs the command that is being run, and the time it took to run, which is a good practice for debugging and performance monitoring. 

The code also handles the case where the extra_env argument is None, which is a good practice for robustness. 

In conclusion, this code is well-written and does not have a command injection vulnerability.
