Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. The reason is the use of the eval() function. The eval() function is used to evaluate the Python expression which can be a function call, passed within it. If the function is used like in this code, it can lead to code injection because it executes the argument like a python expression which can make your program behave in an unexpected way. If an attacker can control the input to the eval() function, they can potentially run any code they wish.
