Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. The reason is that it uses the subprocess.run() function with user-supplied input (args), which can be a potential security risk if not handled properly. If an attacker can control the 'args' input, they could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the system. This is a common vulnerability known as command injection. To mitigate this, it's recommended to use shell=False in subprocess.run() to prevent shell injection attacks, and always sanitize and validate user inputs.
