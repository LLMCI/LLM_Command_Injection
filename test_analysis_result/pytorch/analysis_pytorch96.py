Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that it uses the `subprocess.Popen` function with `shell=True` and a string that is formatted with user-supplied input (`pid`). This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands by supplying a specially crafted `pid`. For example, if an attacker provides a `pid` like `; rm -rf /`, it would delete all files in the system. 

To mitigate this, you should avoid using `shell=True` with user-supplied input. Instead, you can use a list of arguments and let `subprocess.Popen` handle the escaping. For example:

```python
pgrep = subprocess.Popen(args=["pgrep", "-P", str(pid)], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
```

This way, the `pid` is treated as a single argument to the `pgrep` command, and not part of the shell command itself.
