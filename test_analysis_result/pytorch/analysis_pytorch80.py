No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that the subprocess.run() function is being called with a list of arguments (args), rather than a single string. When a list of arguments is used, the first item in the list is the command, and the remaining items are the arguments to that command. This means that even if an attacker were to try to inject malicious code into one of the arguments, it would not be executed as a separate command. Instead, it would simply be passed as an argument to the original command, which would likely result in an error. 

In contrast, if subprocess.run() were called with a single string containing a command and its arguments, an attacker could potentially inject additional commands into that string, leading to a command injection vulnerability. But that's not the case here.
