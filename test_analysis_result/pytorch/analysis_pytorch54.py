No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that the code does not take any user input or external input that could be manipulated to inject malicious commands or code. The subprocess that is run is a Python script that is constructed within the function itself, and all the variables used in the script are either hard-coded or passed as parameters to the function. The parameters are used in a way that does not allow for arbitrary command execution. They are either used as arguments to functions or inserted into strings that are not executed as commands. Therefore, there is no opportunity for an attacker to inject malicious commands or code.
