No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that the subprocess.run() function is used correctly with a list of arguments instead of a single string. This means that the arguments are passed directly to the command and not interpreted by a shell. Therefore, even if an argument contains shell metacharacters or other special characters, they won't be interpreted and executed as commands. 

The only inputs that are used to form the command are 'files' and 'message', and they are appended as separate elements in the list, not concatenated into a command string. This means that even if they contain special characters or command sequences, they will be treated as literal text, not commands. 

However, it's important to ensure that the 'files' and 'message' inputs are validated and sanitized at the point where they are received, to prevent other types of injection attacks or errors.
