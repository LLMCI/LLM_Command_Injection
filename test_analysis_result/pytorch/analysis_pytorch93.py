No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that the arguments passed to the subprocess.Popen function are static and do not include any user input or external data that could be manipulated for injection. The environment variables "PYTORCH_TEST_RANGE_START" and "PYTORCH_TEST_RANGE_END" are set to integer values, which are also not susceptible to injection. 

However, it's always a good practice to validate and sanitize all inputs in a production environment.
