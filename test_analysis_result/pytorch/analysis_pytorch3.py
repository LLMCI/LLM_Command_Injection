No, this code does not have potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The code uses the subprocess module to execute Python scripts, but the arguments passed to the subprocess are hard-coded and do not include any user input or external data sources. Therefore, there is no opportunity for an attacker to inject malicious commands or code. 

The only dynamic part of the command is the current working directory (cwd), which is determined by the location of the script file itself. This is not a security risk as it does not allow for the execution of arbitrary commands or code. 

In general, command or code injection vulnerabilities occur when an application includes untrusted data in a command or query that it intends to execute. In this case, there is no such data being included in the commands.
