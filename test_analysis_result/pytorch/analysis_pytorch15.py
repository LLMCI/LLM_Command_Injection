Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The vulnerability lies in the subprocess.check_output() function. This function is used to run a shell command and return its output. The problem is that it's using user-supplied input (filename) as part of the command. If an attacker can control the filename, they could potentially inject arbitrary commands. For example, if an attacker provides a filename like "; rm -rf /", it could delete all files in the system. 

To mitigate this, it's recommended to use the subprocess.run() function with an array of arguments instead of a single string, which ensures that user-supplied input is not interpreted as shell commands. Also, always validate and sanitize user inputs to ensure they do not contain any malicious values.
