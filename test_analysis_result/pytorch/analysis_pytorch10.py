No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The code is using the subprocess module to execute system commands, which can be a potential point of injection. However, the arguments passed to the subprocess.check_output function are hardcoded and do not include any user input or external data that could be manipulated by an attacker. 

The code is also using os.path.join to construct file paths, but again, these paths are constructed from hardcoded strings and variables, not user input or external data. 

Therefore, there is no point in this code where an attacker could inject malicious commands or code.
