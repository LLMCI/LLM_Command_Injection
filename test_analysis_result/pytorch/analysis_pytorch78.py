No, this code does not have potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that the code does not take any user input to form the command that is executed by the subprocess module. All the commands and arguments used in the subprocess.run() and subprocess.Popen() calls are hardcoded and do not depend on any external input. 

Command or code injection vulnerabilities occur when an application includes untrusted data in a command that it executes or in code that it interprets. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious commands or code. In this case, since there is no untrusted data included in the commands, there is no command/code injection vulnerability.
