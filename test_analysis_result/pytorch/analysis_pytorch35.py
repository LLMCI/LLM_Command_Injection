No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. The subprocess.check_output() function is used to run a Python script, but the script is a hardcoded string and does not include any user input or external data that could be manipulated for injection. The parameters passed to the subprocess.check_output() function are also hardcoded and do not include any user input or external data. Therefore, there is no opportunity for an attacker to inject malicious commands or code.
