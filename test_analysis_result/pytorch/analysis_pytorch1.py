Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that the code uses the exec() function to execute Python code, which is taken from the arguments of the function or read from a file. If an attacker can control the input to this function or the contents of the file, they can execute arbitrary Python code. This is a classic code injection vulnerability. 

Moreover, the code also uses os.chdir() function which changes the current working directory to a path provided by the user. If an attacker can control the input to this function, they can potentially cause the program to read, write or execute files in arbitrary directories, leading to further vulnerabilities. 

Lastly, the subprocess.run() function is used without any sanitization or validation of the input arguments. This can lead to command injection vulnerabilities if an attacker can control the input arguments. 

Therefore, it is recommended to properly sanitize and validate all user inputs and avoid using functions like exec() and subprocess.run() with user-controlled inputs.
