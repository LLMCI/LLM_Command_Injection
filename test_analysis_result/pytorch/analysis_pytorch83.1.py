Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. The reason is that it directly uses the input from the user (or another untrusted source) as arguments in the subprocess.run() function. If an attacker can control the input, they can execute arbitrary commands on the system. This is a classic command injection vulnerability. To mitigate this, the code should never trust user input. It should sanitize and validate the input before using it.
