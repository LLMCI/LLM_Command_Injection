No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

Command or code injection vulnerabilities typically occur when untrusted input is directly included in a command that is executed by the system. In this code, the command that is executed by the subprocess.Popen function is a static command that does not include any user input. The arguments to the command are also static and do not include any user input. Therefore, there is no opportunity for an attacker to inject malicious commands or code. 

However, it's important to note that while this code does not have a command or code injection vulnerability, it may have other types of vulnerabilities. For example, if the 'args.filename' is user-controlled and not properly sanitized, it could lead to a path traversal vulnerability.
