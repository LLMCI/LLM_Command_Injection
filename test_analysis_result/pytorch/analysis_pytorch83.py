Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. The reason is that it uses the subprocess.run() function with user-supplied input (args), which can be a potential security risk if not handled properly. If an attacker can control the input to the subprocess.run() function, they can execute arbitrary commands on the system. This is a classic command injection vulnerability. To mitigate this, it's recommended to use shell=False in the subprocess.run() function and to properly sanitize and validate all user-supplied input.
