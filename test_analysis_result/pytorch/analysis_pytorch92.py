Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. The reason is that it uses the `subprocess.Popen` function with `shell=True`, which means that it's passing the command to the shell and this can be exploited. If an attacker can control the `command` input, they can execute arbitrary commands on the system. This is a common security issue known as shell injection. To mitigate this, it's recommended to use `shell=False` and pass the command as a list of arguments.
