No, this code does not have potential command/code injection vulnerability. The reason is that the code does not take any external input that could be manipulated by a user to inject malicious code. The inputs are hard-coded and the operations performed on these inputs are also predefined. The exec function is used, but it is not executing any user-provided or external input. It's only executing a predefined string format operation. Therefore, there is no opportunity for command or code injection in this code.
