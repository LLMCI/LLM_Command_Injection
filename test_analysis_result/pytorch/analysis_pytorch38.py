Yes, this code has a potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The vulnerability lies in the subprocess.check_output() function call. This function is used to run a shell command and return its output. The command that is being run is constructed using string formatting, with the "default_branch" variable being inserted directly into the command string. If an attacker can control the value of "default_branch", they could potentially insert malicious commands or code. 

For example, if "default_branch" was set to "main; rm -rf /", the resulting command would be "git cherry -v main; rm -rf /", which would delete all files in the root directory. 

To mitigate this vulnerability, user-supplied input should never be inserted directly into a command string. Instead, use the argument list form of subprocess.check_output(), which does not allow shell features like command chaining or redirection.
