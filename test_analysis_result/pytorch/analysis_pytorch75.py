No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. The reason is that it uses a list of strings as arguments for the subprocess.run() function. This means that the arguments are not processed through a shell and therefore, shell injection attacks are not possible. If a string was used instead of a list, and shell=True was set, then there would be a potential for command injection. But in this case, the code is safe from command injection attacks.
