Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that it uses the exec() function to execute the code, which is read from a file. If an attacker can control the content of the file, they can inject arbitrary Python code, which will be executed when the load_by_key_path function is called. This can lead to serious security issues, such as remote code execution, data leakage, or denial of service. 

Moreover, the function does not perform any sanitization or validation on the input file content before executing it, which increases the risk of code injection attacks. 

It's recommended to avoid using exec() whenever possible, and if it's necessary, use it with caution, making sure to properly sanitize and validate the input.
