No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability.

The reason is that the subprocess.run() function is being used safely. The command and its arguments are passed as a list, which means that they are not processed through a shell interpreter. This prevents shell injection attacks because the arguments are not interpreted as shell commands.

In addition, the data that is being passed to the subprocess (the json_str variable) is being generated from a known structure (the m variable) using the json.dumps() function. This means that even if an attacker could control the contents of m, they could not inject arbitrary commands because the data is being properly escaped by the json.dumps() function.
