No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that all the commands and arguments passed to the subprocess functions are hardcoded and do not depend on user input. The only dynamic part is the 'GIT_DEFAULT_BRANCH' environment variable, but it is used in a safe way. It is directly concatenated into a string and passed as an argument to the git command, not executed or evaluated in any way. Therefore, even if an attacker controls the 'GIT_DEFAULT_BRANCH' environment variable, they cannot inject arbitrary commands or code.
