Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that it uses the shell=True parameter in the subprocess.Popen() function. This means that the specified command will be executed through the shell. This can be a security hazard if combined with untrusted input. An attacker could inject malicious commands which will be executed by the shell. 

To mitigate this risk, it's recommended to use shell=False whenever possible, or sanitize the input if shell=True is necessary.
