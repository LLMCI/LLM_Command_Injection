No, this code does not have potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The code is creating a temporary directory, writing a C++ source file to it, compiling it using PyTorch's cpp_extension.load function, and then running the resulting executable. The arguments to the subprocess.run function, which is used to execute the compiled code, are hardcoded and do not include any user input. Therefore, there is no opportunity for an attacker to inject malicious commands or code. 

The only external input to the subprocess.run function is the path to the executable, which is generated by the script itself and does not depend on any user input. The shell argument to subprocess.run is also hardcoded and does not depend on any user input. 

Therefore, there is no command or code injection vulnerability in this code.
