Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. The reason is that it uses the `subprocess.run` function with user-supplied input (`args`). If an attacker can control the `args` value, they could potentially execute arbitrary commands. This is especially risky when `shell=True` is set, as it is in this code when running on Windows (`IS_WINDOWS`), because it runs the command through the shell, which has its own command interpretation and could lead to unexpected command execution if the input is not properly sanitized.
