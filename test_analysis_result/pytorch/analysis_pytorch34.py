Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that it uses the `subprocess.run` function with a list of arguments (`args`) that are directly passed into it. If an attacker can control the content of `args`, they could potentially execute arbitrary commands. For example, if `args` is `["ls", ";", "rm", "-rf", "/"]`, it would delete all files in the system. 

To mitigate this, it's recommended to use the `subprocess.run` function with the `shell=False` parameter (which is the default), and ensure that user input is properly sanitized before it's used as part of command arguments.
