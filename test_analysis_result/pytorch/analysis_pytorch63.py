Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is the use of the eval() function. The eval() function is used to evaluate the specified expression. If the expression is a correct Python statement, it will be executed. This can be potentially dangerous if you are allowing user input, as it can run arbitrary code beyond the intended scope of the function. 

In this case, the eval() function is used to dynamically create a lambda function with a variable number of arguments. If an attacker can control the 'nargs' or 'fn' input, they could inject malicious code that would be executed by the eval() function. 

For example, if 'nargs' is set to a string that contains Python code, this code will be executed when the eval() function is called. Similarly, if 'fn' is set to a string that contains Python code, this code will be executed when the lambda function is called. 

Therefore, it's recommended to avoid using eval() whenever possible, especially with user-supplied input.
