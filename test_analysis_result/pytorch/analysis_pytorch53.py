No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that the command that is being run by the subprocess is not being constructed using any user-provided or externally-provided input. All the arguments to the command are hard-coded strings or variables that are not influenced by external input. Therefore, there is no opportunity for an attacker to inject arbitrary commands or code.
