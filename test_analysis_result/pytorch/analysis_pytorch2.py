Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. The reason is that it uses the `subprocess.run()` function with `shell=True` and the command it runs (`cmd`) is a parameter of the function. This means that if an attacker can control the value of `cmd`, they can execute arbitrary commands on the system where this code is running. This is a classic command injection vulnerability. The `limit` parameter is also directly included in the command string, which could lead to injection if it's not properly validated or escaped.
