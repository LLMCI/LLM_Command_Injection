No, this code does not appear to have potential command/code injection vulnerabilities. 

The code is primarily defining a class and its methods, and it does not seem to execute any arbitrary commands or code based on user input. The eval() function is used, but it is used with predefined scopes and variables, not with user input. 

However, it's important to note that while this code snippet doesn't appear to have injection vulnerabilities, it's possible that other parts of the code (not shown here) could introduce vulnerabilities. For example, if user input is used to construct the 'name' argument for the 'get' method without proper sanitization, it could potentially lead to code injection. 

As a best practice, always sanitize and validate user inputs, and avoid using eval() with user inputs whenever possible.
