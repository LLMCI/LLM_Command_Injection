No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. The reason is that it uses a list or tuple of tokens as the command to be executed, rather than a string. This means that the command is not processed through a shell, and so shell injection attacks are not possible. The assert statement at the beginning of the function ensures that a string is not passed as the command. If a string were passed, the function would raise an AssertionError.
