Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that it uses the `subprocess.Popen` function with `shell=True` and a command string that is constructed using format strings (`f'{sys.executable} -u {loc}/mkl_verbose.py --verbose-level=0'`). This can be dangerous if the `sys.executable` or `loc` variables are somehow controlled by an attacker, as they could inject arbitrary commands to be executed. 

Even though in this specific case it seems like `sys.executable` and `loc` are not directly controlled by user input, it's generally a good practice to avoid using `shell=True` with dynamically constructed command strings to prevent potential command injection vulnerabilities. Instead, it's safer to pass the command and its arguments as a list of strings to `subprocess.Popen`.
