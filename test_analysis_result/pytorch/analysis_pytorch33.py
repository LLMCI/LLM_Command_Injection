No, this code does not have potential command/code injection vulnerability. The reason is that the subprocess.check_output() function is being used with a list of arguments instead of a single string. This means that the arguments are passed directly to the program without going through a shell, and thus there is no opportunity for shell injection. The "which" and "dot" arguments are hard-coded and do not depend on user input, so there is no risk of command injection in this case.
