No, this code does not have potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The code is using Python's built-in exec() function to execute dynamically created Python code. However, the dynamic code is created using a template and the only variable part of the code is the list creation, which is taken from a predefined list of strings. There is no user input or external data being inserted into the code, so there is no opportunity for an attacker to inject malicious code. 

The exec() function is being used in a controlled manner and the scope of the execution is limited to the current global and local variables, further reducing the potential for malicious activity. 

However, it's worth noting that the use of exec() is generally discouraged due to the potential for code injection attacks if not used carefully. In this case, it appears to be used safely, but in other contexts, it could be a risk.
