Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. The reason is that it uses the exec() function, which executes the Python code it is passed. If an attacker can control the input (astr) to the runstring function, they can execute arbitrary Python code. This could lead to a variety of attacks, including data theft, data corruption, denial of service, or even full system control, depending on the permissions of the process running the Python code.
