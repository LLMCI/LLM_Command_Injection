Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that the code uses the `subprocess.Popen` function to execute shell commands and the arguments of these commands are taken from the function parameters (`target` and `nm_command`). If an attacker can control the values of these parameters, they can inject malicious commands. For example, if the `target` parameter is set to `; rm -rf /`, it would delete all files in the root directory. 

To mitigate this risk, the code should validate and sanitize the input parameters to ensure they do not contain any malicious commands. It's also recommended to use safer methods to execute shell commands, such as `subprocess.run` with `shell=False` and a list of arguments, which avoids shell interpretation of the input.
