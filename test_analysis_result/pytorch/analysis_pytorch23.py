No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that the subprocess.run() function is being called with a list of arguments (args), which is the recommended way to avoid shell injection vulnerabilities. When the command and its arguments are provided as a list, they are not processed through a shell interpreter, which means that shell metacharacters (like ;, &&, ||, etc.) do not have any special meaning. This is in contrast to providing the command as a string, which would be processed through a shell interpreter and could potentially lead to command injection if the string contains user-controlled input. 

However, it's important to note that while this specific piece of code does not have a command injection vulnerability, the overall security of the application would also depend on how this function is being used - specifically, whether untrusted input can end up in the 'args' list.
