Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that it uses the `subprocess.Popen` function with `shell=True` and a formatted string as the command. This can be dangerous if the variables used in the formatted string come from an untrusted source or user input, as it could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. In this case, the `sys.executable` and `loc` variables are used to construct the command. If an attacker can control the value of these variables, they could inject malicious commands. 

Even though in this specific code snippet, `sys.executable` and `loc` seem to be safe, it's a good practice to avoid using `shell=True` with a formatted string to prevent potential command injection vulnerabilities.
