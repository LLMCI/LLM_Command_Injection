No, this code does not have potential command/code injection vulnerabilities. 

The reason is that the code uses static, hard-coded commands for the subprocess calls. It does not use any user-provided input to form the command, which is the common way command injection vulnerabilities are introduced. The arguments to the subprocess calls are also static and do not include any user-provided input. Therefore, there is no opportunity for an attacker to inject malicious commands.
