No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The code is using the subprocess module to execute commands, which can be a potential source of command injection vulnerabilities. However, in this case, the commands being executed are not being constructed from user input or other potentially unsafe sources. The commands are predefined in the COMMON_TESTS and GPU_TESTS variables, and the only dynamic part of the command is the "python_commands" variable, which is also taken from these predefined tests. 

The only environment variables used are "USE_CUDA" and "WindowsSdkDir", and these are only used to control the flow of the program and to construct a file path, not to construct a command. 

Therefore, there is no opportunity for an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into this code.
