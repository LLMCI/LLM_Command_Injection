Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that the exec() function is used, which is a potentially dangerous function that executes the Python code it is passed as a string. This can be a serious security risk if the string of code is constructed using untrusted input, as it allows for the execution of arbitrary Python code. This could lead to command injection attacks where an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system.
