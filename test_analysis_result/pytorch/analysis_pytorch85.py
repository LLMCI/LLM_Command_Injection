Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. The reason is that it directly uses the input string `cmd` as the command to execute in `subprocess.run()`. If an attacker can control the value of `cmd`, they can execute arbitrary commands on the system where this code is running. This is a classic command injection vulnerability. To mitigate this, the code should never execute commands directly based on user input. Instead, it should use safe APIs that allow it to perform the necessary operations without the risk of command injection.
