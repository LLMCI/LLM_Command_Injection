Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. The vulnerability lies in the use of the eval() function in the deserialize_args() function. The eval() function is used to evaluate the Python expression which could be a string input from the user. If a malicious user is able to control the input to the eval() function, they could potentially execute arbitrary Python code. This is a common security issue known as code injection. In this case, the eval() function is used to evaluate the 'inps' variable, which could potentially be controlled by a user.
