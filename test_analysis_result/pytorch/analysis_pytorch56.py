Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that it uses the `subprocess.run` function with user-supplied input (`args`). If an attacker can control the `args` value, they could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the system. 

Even though the `shell` argument is set to `IS_WINDOWS`, which might limit the scope of potential attacks, it doesn't eliminate the risk. If `IS_WINDOWS` is True, the command will be executed through the shell, which can lead to shell injection vulnerabilities if the command string is constructed using user-supplied input.

To mitigate this risk, it's recommended to avoid using `subprocess.run` with user-supplied input whenever possible. If it's necessary to use user input in a subprocess command, the input should be properly sanitized and validated to ensure it doesn't contain any malicious values.
