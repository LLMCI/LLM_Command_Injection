Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. The reason is the use of the exec() function. The exec() function is used to execute dynamically created program, which can be a source of code injection if the input is not properly sanitized. In this case, the exec() function is executing 'module_code' which is not defined in the provided code snippet. If 'module_code' is coming from an untrusted source or user input, it could lead to code injection.
