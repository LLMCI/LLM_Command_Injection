Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. The reason is the use of the exec() function. This function is used to execute dynamically created program, which can be a string of code. If an attacker can control the input to the exec() function, they can execute arbitrary commands or code. This is a common security issue known as code injection. In this case, the 'code' parameter is passed directly into exec() without any sanitization or validation, which could lead to potential code injection if 'code' contains malicious input.
