No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The code is using the `ast` module to parse and transform Python code, which is a safe operation. The `exec` function is used to execute the transformed code, but the code it's executing is derived from the input function `fn`, not from user input or an external source. 

The `exec` function can be a source of command injection vulnerabilities if it's used to execute arbitrary code provided by an untrusted source. However, in this case, it's being used to execute code that's already part of the program, so there's no opportunity for command injection. 

The `globals_dict` is copied from `fn.__globals__`, which is the global namespace of the function `fn`. This is also a safe operation, as it's just copying the function's existing global variables, not introducing any new ones. 

In conclusion, this code is safe from command/code injection vulnerabilities because it does not execute arbitrary code from an untrusted source.
