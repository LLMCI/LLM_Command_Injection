No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that the subprocess.run() function is called with shell=False, which means that the command is executed directly without going through a shell. This prevents shell injection attacks because the command and its arguments are not interpreted by a shell, but are passed directly to the system's command executor. 

Moreover, the arguments to the command are passed as a list of strings, which also helps to prevent command injection attacks because each argument is treated as a separate entity and not concatenated into a single string that could be manipulated to change the command's behavior. 

However, it's important to note that the safety of this function depends on how it's used - if untrusted input is passed as an argument, it could still lead to security issues.
