No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. The reason is that it uses the subprocess.run() function with a list of command-line arguments, which are passed directly to the program. This means that the command-line arguments are not interpreted by a shell, and thus cannot be used to inject arbitrary shell commands. If the code were to use subprocess.run() with a single string argument and shell=True, then it would be vulnerable to command injection if the string were constructed from untrusted input. However, that is not the case here.
