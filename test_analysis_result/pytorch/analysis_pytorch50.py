Yes, this code has a potential command/code injection vulnerability. The vulnerability lies in the line where the branch name is concatenated directly into the command that is passed to subprocess.run(). If an attacker can control the value of the branch variable, they could potentially inject arbitrary commands. For example, if branch is set to "master; rm -rf /", the resulting command would be "git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/master; rm -rf /", which would delete all files in the root directory. To mitigate this, the branch name should be properly sanitized before being used in a command.
