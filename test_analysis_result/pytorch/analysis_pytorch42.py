No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The command that is being run is hardcoded and does not include any user input. The arguments that are added to the command are either hardcoded or generated by the program itself, not from an external, untrusted source. 

The environment variables are copied from the current environment and potentially modified, but again, this is not based on user input. 

The subprocess.run function is used to execute the command, but it is used correctly, with the command and arguments passed as a list, which prevents shell injection attacks. 

Therefore, there is no opportunity for an attacker to inject malicious commands or code.
