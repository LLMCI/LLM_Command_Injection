Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. The reason is that the function `export_target` constructs a command string `cmd` that is directly passed to `os.system(cmd)`. The command string includes user-supplied input such as `binary_file`, `shared_library_list`, `merged_file`, and `json_file`. If an attacker can control these inputs, they can inject arbitrary commands to be executed on the system. For example, if `binary_file` is set to `"; rm -rf /"`, the resulting command could delete all files on the system. To mitigate this, the code should use safer methods for running system commands that allow for argument lists, such as `subprocess.run()`, and should validate and sanitize all user inputs.
