No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that the code does not execute any command that includes user-supplied input. The command that is executed (`nvcc --version`) is hard-coded and does not include any variable parts. The only input to the `subprocess.check_output` function is a list that contains the path to the `nvcc` executable and the `--version` argument. Neither of these can be influenced by a user. 

The code does use the `subprocess.check_output` function, which can be a source of command injection vulnerabilities if used improperly. However, in this case, it is used safely. 

The code also uses the `re.search` function to parse the output of the `nvcc --version` command. This could potentially be a source of code injection vulnerabilities if the regular expression pattern was constructed using user-supplied input. However, in this case, the pattern is hard-coded and does not include any variable parts. 

Therefore, there is no command/code injection vulnerability in this code.
