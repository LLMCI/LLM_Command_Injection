No, this code does not have potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The code uses the subprocess module to execute system commands, which can be a potential point of vulnerability if user-supplied input is directly used in the command. However, in this case, the command being executed is sys.executable (which is the Python interpreter itself) and the argument to it is a filename generated by the TemporaryFileName context manager. There is no user-supplied input being directly used in the command, so there is no scope for command injection.

Moreover, the code does not use any eval or exec functions, which are other common points of code injection vulnerabilities. The code is also not using any user-supplied input to dynamically import modules or to access file paths, which can be other potential points of code injection vulnerabilities. 

Therefore, based on the provided code, there is no command/code injection vulnerability.
