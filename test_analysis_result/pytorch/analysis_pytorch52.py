Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. The reason is the use of the exec() function, which executes the Python code it is passed as a string. This can be dangerous if the source of the string is untrusted, as it could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary Python code. In this case, the string is passed from the 'src' parameter of the '_exec_with_source' function, and there are no checks to ensure that this string is safe before it is executed.
