Yes, this code has potential command/code injection vulnerability. The reason is that the function takes an argument `nvcc_path` which is directly used in a subprocess call without any sanitization or validation. If an attacker can control the value of `nvcc_path`, they could potentially inject arbitrary commands. For example, if `nvcc_path` is set to `nvcc; rm -rf /`, it would delete all files in the root directory. To prevent this, the code should validate that `nvcc_path` is a safe value before using it in a subprocess call.
