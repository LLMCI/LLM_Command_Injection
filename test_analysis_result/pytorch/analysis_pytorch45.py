No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The code is using subprocess.Popen and subprocess.check_call to execute system commands, but the arguments to these commands are not being constructed from user input or other potentially unsafe sources. They are hardcoded strings and the path of a file generated within the code itself. 

Command injection vulnerabilities occur when an attacker is able to influence the commands or code that is executed by a system. In this case, there is no opportunity for an attacker to influence the commands being executed.
