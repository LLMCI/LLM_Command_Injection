No, this code does not have a potential command/code injection vulnerability. The reason is that it uses the subprocess.run() function with a list of arguments (args), which is a safer way to execute subprocesses as it does not involve shell processing. This means that the arguments are not interpreted as shell commands, which is where the risk of command injection lies. Instead, they are passed directly to the program being run. This is a recommended way to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.
