No, this code does not have potential command/code injection vulnerability. 

The reason is that the subprocess.run() function is used to execute a command, but the command and its arguments are provided as a list of strings, which are not modifiable by an external user input. This means that the command is not constructed using string formatting or concatenation with user-provided data, which are common places where command injection vulnerabilities can occur. 

Moreover, the code does not seem to use any user-provided data to form the command to be executed. The only input to the function is a binary string, which is used directly as one of the arguments in the command. This binary string is not used in a way that could allow for command injection. 

Therefore, the code appears to be safe from command/code injection vulnerabilities.
